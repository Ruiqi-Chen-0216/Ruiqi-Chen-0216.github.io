[Immersive Biography: Supporting Intercultural Empathy and Understanding for Displaced Cultural Objects in Virtual Reality](https://ruiqichen338.github.io/)

Ke Zhao, **Ruiqi Chen**, Xiaziyu Zhang, Chenxi Wang, Siling Chen, Xiaoguang Wang, Yujue Wang, Xin Tong

[**Paper will come soon**]
- This paper presents an immersive VR biography of the Admonitions Scroll to explore how embodied interactions with displaced cultural objects can promote intercultural empathy. Our findings showed that such interactions enhance understanding and interest in cultural heritage, offering a novel approach to representing and interpreting historical artifacts.

[DIAM: Drone-based Indoor Accessibility Mapping](https://makeabilitylab.cs.washington.edu/project/diam/)

Xia Su, **Ruiqi Chen**, Weiye Zhang, Jingwei Ma, Jon E. Froehlich

[**Project**](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3672539.3686782) <strong><span class='show_paper_citations' data='DhtAFkwAAAAJ:ALROH1vI_8AC'></span></strong>
- This paper introduces Drone-based Indoor Accessibility Mapping (DIAM), a drone-based indoor scanning system that efficiently produces 3D reconstructions of indoor spaces with key accessibility facilities recognized and located in the model. With DIAM, users can scan indoor spaces quickly and generate a precise, detailed, and visual 3D indoor accessibility map.
