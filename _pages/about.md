I am Ruiqi Chen, I am currently pursuing a Master of Science in  [Human Centered Design & Engineering](https://www.hcde.washington.edu/) at the **University of Washington**, affiliated with [Makeability Lab](https://makeabilitylab.cs.washington.edu/) by [Prof. Jon E. Froehlich](https://jonfroehlich.github.io/) and [ACE Lab](https://depts.washington.edu/acelab/index.html) by [Prof. Jacob O. Wobbrock](https://faculty.washington.edu/wobbrock/). I also collaborate closely with [Prof. Aditya Parameswaran](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~adityagp/) at the **University of California, Berkeley**. Previously, I obtained my Dual B.S. degree in Data Science from Duke University and Duke Kunshan University, where I worked with [Prof. Xin Tong](https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=XIM08ZwAAAAJ&hl=en) in [HCI Lab](https://arkxlab.github.io/).

My research interests lie primarily at the intersection of Human-Computer Interaction(HCI) and Artificial Intelligence(AI), combining human and machine intelligence to create interactive systems for creativity, collaboration, and beyond. In my past four years of research experience, my research scope has included human-centered AI, Computer Vision, LLM & VLM, and Machine Learning.

**<span style="font-size: 24px;">I am enthusiastically pursuing a PhD position in CS starting from 2026 fall!</span>**
