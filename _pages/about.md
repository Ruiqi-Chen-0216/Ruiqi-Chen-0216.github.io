I am Ruiqi Chen, I am currently pursuing a Master of Science in  [Human Centered Design & Engineering](https://www.hcde.washington.edu/) at the **University of Washington**, affiliated with [Makeability Lab](https://makeabilitylab.cs.washington.edu/) advised by [Prof. Jon E. Froehlich](https://jonfroehlich.github.io/) and [ACE Lab](https://depts.washington.edu/acelab/index.html) advised by [Prof. Jacob O. Wobbrock](https://faculty.washington.edu/wobbrock/). Previously, I received my [Dual Bachelor's degree in Data Science](https://undergraduate.bulletins.duke.edu/allprograms/dukekunshanprogram) from **Duke University** and **Duke Kunshan University** in May 2024, , and was an undergraduate researcher scientist in [@DKU HCI Lab](https://dkuhcigroup.github.io/) advised by [Prof. Xin Tong](https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=XIM08ZwAAAAJ&hl=en).

My research interests lie primarily at the intersection of Human-Computer Interaction(HCI) and Artificial Intelligence(AI), combining human and machine intelligence to create interactive systems for accessibility, collaboration, and beyond. In my past three years of research experience, my research scope has included Human-Centered AI, Human-AI Collaboration, Computer Vision, Machine Learning, Extended Reality (XR), and Virtual Reality (VR).

**<span style="font-size: 24px;">I am enthusiastically pursuing a PhD position in CS&HCI starting from 2026 fall!</span>**
