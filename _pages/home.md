<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am Ruiqi Chen, I am currently pursuing a Master of Science in  [Human Centered Design & Engineering](https://www.hcde.washington.edu/) at the **University of Washington**, affiliated with [Makeability Lab](https://makeabilitylab.cs.washington.edu/) by [Prof. Jon E. Froehlich](https://jonfroehlich.github.io/) and [ACE Lab](https://depts.washington.edu/acelab/index.html) by [Prof. Jacob O. Wobbrock](https://faculty.washington.edu/wobbrock/). Previously, I received my Dual Bachelor's degree in Data Science from **Duke University** and **Duke Kunshan University** in May 2024, and was an undergraduate researcher scientist in [DKU HCI Lab](https://arkxlab.github.io/) advised by [Prof. Xin Tong](https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=XIM08ZwAAAAJ&hl=en).

My research interests lie primarily at the intersection of Human-Computer Interaction(HCI) and Artificial Intelligence(AI), combining human and machine intelligence to create interactive systems for accessibility, collaboration, and beyond. In my past three years of research experience, my research scope has included Human-Centered AI, Human-AI Collaboration, Computer Vision, Machine Learning, Extended Reality (XR), and Virtual Reality (VR).

**<span style="font-size: 24px;">I am enthusiastically pursuing a PhD position in CS&HCI starting from 2026 fall!</span>**

[Immersive Biography: Supporting Intercultural Empathy and Understanding for Displaced Cultural Objects in Virtual Reality](https://ruiqichen338.github.io/)

Ke Zhao, **Ruiqi Chen**, Xiaziyu Zhang, Chenxi Wang, Siling Chen, Xiaoguang Wang, Yujue Wang, Xin Tong

[**Paper will come soon**]() <strong><span class='show_paper_citations' data='DhtAFkwAAAAJ:ALROH1vI_8AC'></span></strong>
- This paper presents an immersive VR biography of the Admonitions Scroll to explore how embodied interactions with displaced cultural objects can promote intercultural empathy. Through a study with 24 participants, findings showed that such interactions enhance understanding and interest in cultural heritage, offering a novel approach to representing and interpreting historical artifacts.

[DIAM: Drone-based Indoor Accessibility Mapping](https://makeabilitylab.cs.washington.edu/project/diam/)

Xia Su, **Ruiqi Chen**, Weiye Zhang, Jingwei Ma, Jon E. Froehlich

[**Project**](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3672539.3686782) <strong><span class='show_paper_citations' data='DhtAFkwAAAAJ:ALROH1vI_8AC'></span></strong>
- This paper introduces Drone-based Indoor Accessibility Mapping (DIAM), a drone-based indoor scanning system that efficiently produces 3D reconstructions of indoor spaces with key accessibility facilities recognized and located in the model. With DIAM, users can scan indoor spaces quickly and generate a precise, detailed, and visual 3D indoor accessibility map.
