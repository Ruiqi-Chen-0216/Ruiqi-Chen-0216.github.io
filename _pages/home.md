<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am Ruiqi Chen, I am currently pursuing a Master of Science in  [Human Centered Design & Engineering](https://www.hcde.washington.edu/) at the **University of Washington**, affiliated with [Makeability Lab](https://makeabilitylab.cs.washington.edu/) by [Prof. Jon E. Froehlich](https://jonfroehlich.github.io/) and [ACE Lab](https://depts.washington.edu/acelab/index.html) by [Prof. Jacob O. Wobbrock](https://faculty.washington.edu/wobbrock/). Previously, I received my Dual Bachelor's degree in Data Science from **Duke University** and **Duke Kunshan University** in May 2024, and was an undergraduate researcher in [DKU HCI Lab](https://arkxlab.github.io/) advised by [Prof. Xin Tong](https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=XIM08ZwAAAAJ&hl=en).

My research interests lie primarily at the intersection of Human-Computer Interaction(HCI) and Artificial Intelligence(AI), combining human and machine intelligence to create interactive systems for creativity, collaboration, and beyond. In my past three years of research experience, my research scope has included human-centered AI, Computer Vision, and Machine Learning.

**<span style="font-size: 24px;">I am enthusiastically pursuing a PhD position in CS starting from 2026 fall!</span>**
