# Personal Website

This project is for building my personal website, with materials and inspiration sourced from [RayeRen's academic homepage](https://github.com/RayeRen/acad-homepage.github.io). I have re-edited and optimized the navigation and page transition logic.

Some examples:
- [Demo Page](https://rayeren.github.io/acad-homepage.github.io/)
- [Personal Homepage of the author](https://rayeren.github.io/)

## Key Features
- **Automatically update Google Scholar citations**: Using a Google Scholar crawler and GitHub Actions, this repo can automatically update author citations and publication citations.
- **Support Google Analytics**: Easily configure to track the traffic of your homepage.
- **Responsive**: This homepage automatically adjusts for different screen sizes and viewports.
- **Beautiful and Simple Design**: A clean and elegant design that is ideal for an academic personal homepage.
- **SEO**: Search Engine Optimization (SEO) helps search engines easily find and rank the information published on your homepage.
